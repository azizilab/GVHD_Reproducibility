GVHD Data Analysis

Overview

This repository contains the code and data analysis pipeline for our study on acute Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD) following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) in collaboration with Reshef Lab. Acute GVHD is a potentially fatal complication where donor T cells attack recipient tissues. Our study aims to identify reliable biomarkers and uncover the mechanisms of T cell-mediated damage using a combination of in vitro assays, high-throughput sequencing, and spatial transcriptomics.

Study Design

To understand the interaction between donor T cells and host tissues:

We performed mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLRs) combined with high-throughput TCR sequencing to identify alloreactive T cell fingerprints across 20 patients, with 5â€“12 timepoints per patient. A subset of patients received Post-Transplant Cyclophosphamide (PTCy).
We profiled immune cells in gut biopsies from 14 GVHD patients and two normal donors using paired single-cell transcriptomics and TCR sequencing.
We further examined spatial transcriptomics data to elucidate the tissue architecture and cell-cell interactions underlying GvHD.
